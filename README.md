# Guessing Game with PHP and HTML

This is a simple guessing game developed in PHP that uses HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly interactive interface.

## Description

The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the user must guess the number. For each guess, the program indicates whether the guess is too high or too low. The user has up to 6 attempts to guess the number. After guessing correctly or running out of attempts, the game displays a final message and offers the option to restart.

## Features

- Random number generation (between 1 and 20).
- Simple web interface built with HTML and CSS.
- PHP sessions to store the secret number and the number of attempts.
- Dynamic feedback to guide the user’s guesses.
- Option to restart the game at the end.

## Requirements
